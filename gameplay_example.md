## US Player's Turn

### Step 1: Roll Order Dice

The US player rolls 2d6 for Order Points: **5** and **5**.

Taking the higher result, they receive **5 Order Points**.

### Step 2: Check for Doubles

**Doubles!** The US player reveals their Hero Die showing **4** and rolls it again.

New roll: **6**. The US player loses their 4 Hero Points but gains **6 Hero Points**.

*A lucky break—the US player now has more Hero Points than they started with.*

---

### Activation 1 *(1 Order Point spent)*

The US player activates the **Sherman Platoon**. Vehicle Units have no Platoon Leader, so they activate as a unit if all participants have LoS to each other and the target.

All three Shermans have LoS to each other and to the PaK40 (16" and 14" away). The US player orders all three Shermans to **Fire** at the PaK40.

**Activation Sequence:**
1. Declare orders ← *Orders declared: Fire at PaK40*
2. Rally Check (suppressed Teams without RFPs)
3. Resolve RFPs
4. Execute orders

**Rally Check:**

No Shermans are suppressed without RFPs. Skip this step.

**Resolving RFPs:**

One Sherman has **2 RFPs** from last turn. Vehicles always resolve RFPs as if in **Hard Cover**.

Roll 2d6, taking the worst result:

| Die | Roll | Result (1=Killed, 2-3=Suppressed, 4+=Ready) |
|-----|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1 | 3 | Suppressed |
| 2 | 5 | Ready |

Worst result: **Suppressed**

The Sherman lurches to a halt—the crew is rattled but alive. The tank is marked Suppressed and cannot Fire, though it remains operational.

**Executing the Fire Order:**

Only two Shermans can Fire. Each has RoF 2 with its 75mm gun = **4 dice**.

*AT weapons firing at non-Vehicle Teams use HE rounds and ignore the Concealment modifier.*

Range: 16" (standard range)

Modifiers:
- Concealment ignored (HE): **+0**
- Not at Long Range: **+0**

Target number: **4+**

Roll 4 dice: **2, 4, 5, 6** = **3 hits**

**Hit Allocation:**

The PaK40 receives **1 hit** (max per non-Vehicle Team). The AT Platoon Leader is within 4"—he receives **1 hit**. The third hit finds no other valid targets.

- PaK40: **1 RFP**
- AT Platoon Leader: **1 RFP**

---

### German Hero Point Interrupt!

The German player sees the Sherman platoon has activated. They spend **1 Hero Point** to activate the **AT Platoon** between US activations, hoping to knock out a tank before the Americans can continue their advance.

The AT PL orders the PaK40 to **Fire** at one of the Ready Shermans.

**Activation Sequence:**
1. Declare orders ← *Orders declared: Fire at Sherman*
2. Rally Check
3. Resolve RFPs
4. Execute orders

**Rally Check:**

The PaK40 is **Suppressed** with **1 RFP** just received. Teams with RFPs may not attempt to Rally themselves.

However, the AT Platoon Leader is in base contact with the PaK40. **Leaders may use their ability to Rally a Team in base contact.**

But first, the Leader must resolve his own RFPs.

**Resolving RFPs:**

The AT Platoon Leader has **1 RFP**. He is in **Hard Cover** (dug in with the gun).

Roll 1d6: **5** = **Ready**

The Leader is Ready and may use his ability.

The PaK40 has **1 RFP** and is **Suppressed**. It must resolve its RFP.

Roll 1d6: **2** = **Suppressed**

The PaK40 remains Suppressed. It cannot Fire.

**Leader Ability - Rally:**

The AT Platoon Leader uses his ability to **Rally** the PaK40 (in base contact).

Rally Check: Roll 4+. Result: **5**. **Success!**

The PaK40 removes its Suppressed marker and is now Ready.

**Executing the Fire Order:**

The PaK40 Fires at the nearest Ready Sherman (16" away).

PaK40 stats: 28" range, RoF 2, AT 5

Modifiers:
- Target is NOT Concealed: **+0**
- Not at Long Range: **+0**

Target number: **4+**

Roll 2 dice: **4, 6** = **2 hits**

**Hit Allocation:**

The targeted Sherman receives the first hit. The other Ready Sherman is within 4"—it receives the second hit.

**Armor Penetration (first hit):**

Compare AT to Armor Rating:
- PaK40 AT: **5**
- Sherman Front Armor: **2**

AT (5) is **greater than** AR (2). The difference is **3**.

Roll a number of dice equal to the difference (3 dice). If any roll a **6**, the Sherman is **DESTROYED**. If no 6 is rolled, the Sherman receives RFPs equal to the weapon's FP.

Roll 3 dice: **2, 4, 6** = **6! DESTROYED!**

The Sherman erupts in flames. Place a wreck marker.

*Wrecks remain on the table, offering concealment when fired through and counting as Difficult Terrain.*

**Armor Penetration (second hit):**

The second Sherman was also hit. AT 5 vs AR 2, difference of 3.

Roll 3 dice: **1, 3, 5** = No 6s

The Sherman is not destroyed but receives **1 RFP** (PaK40 is FP:1).

German Hero Points remaining: **2**

---

### Activation 2 *(1 Order Point spent)*

The US player activates the **Rifle Platoon Leader**, who has LoS to all Teams in his unit.

The PL issues **two orders split between Teams**:

- **Order 1 (Fire)**: Two Rifle Teams and the Bazooka will fire at the MG Teams behind the hedgerow
- **Order 2 (Move)**: The PL and three Rifle Teams will assault the hedgerow

**Activation Sequence:**
1. Declare orders ← *Done*
2. Rally Check
3. Resolve RFPs
4. Execute orders

**Rally Check:**

No Teams are suppressed without RFPs. Skip.

**Resolving RFPs:**

One Rifle Team has **1 RFP**. It is in the wheat field (**Concealment only, no Hard Cover**).

Roll 1d6: **2** = **Killed**

The Team is removed from the table. The US Rifle Platoon is now down to 4 Rifle Teams.

*The US player had hoped the Team survived. Now they're launching an assault with fewer men. The PL will not use Direct Fire—he needs to lead the assault and provide re-rolls in close combat.*

**Executing the Fire Order:**

Two Rifle Teams and the Bazooka fire at the hedgerow. Each Rifle Team has RoF 2, the Bazooka has RoF 1 = **5 dice**.

*The Bazooka fires AT rounds, but against non-Vehicle Teams, AT weapons use HE and ignore concealment from terrain.*

Target: MG Team behind hedgerow, 10" away.

Modifiers:
- Target is Concealed. Bazooka HE ignores this; Rifle fire: **+1**
- Not at Long Range: **+0**

Roll separately:
- Rifle Teams (4 dice) need **5+**: 1, 3, 5, 6 = **2 hits**
- Bazooka (1 die) needs **4+**: 4 = **1 hit**

Total: **3 hits**

**Hit Allocation:**

Three MG Teams are behind the hedgerow. Each receives **1 hit**.

- MG Team 1 (already had 1 RFP): gains **1 RFP** (now has 2 total)
- MG Team 2: **1 RFP**
- MG Team 3: **1 RFP**

---

### Executing the Assault

The PL and three Rifle Teams declare an assault on the hedgerow.

*The Bazooka is a Small Team and cannot participate in assaults.*

**Assault Requirements:**
- Must start within 12" of target: Yes (10" away)
- At least one assaulting Team must be unsuppressed with LoS: Yes

The assaulting Teams declare their destination and roll for movement.

Roll 2d6: **4** and **6** = **10 inches**

The Teams reach the hedgerow and move into **base contact** with defending MG Teams. The hedgerow is a linear obstacle—the US Teams contact it from the US side while the German MG Teams are touching it from the German side.

*No more than 2 assaulting Teams may contact a single defender.*

- Rifle Team A and Rifle Team B contact MG Team 1 (the one with 2 RFPs)
- Rifle Team C contacts MG Team 2
- The PL moves into base contact with Rifle Team A

**Defenders Immediately Activate:**

The three MG Teams behind the hedgerow are immediately activated (no Order Points spent) to resolve RFPs and respond.

**Defender RFP Resolution:**

MG Team 1 has **2 RFPs**. It is in **Hard Cover** (touching hedgerow from opposite side of incoming assault).

Roll 2d6, taking the worst:

| Die | Roll | Result |
|-----|------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | Suppressed |
| 2 | 3 | Suppressed |

Worst result: **Suppressed**

*Any defending Team that is not Ready is destroyed.*

MG Team 1 is **Destroyed**.

MG Team 2 has **1 RFP**, Hard Cover.

Roll 1d6: **1** = **Killed**

MG Team 2 is **Destroyed**.

MG Team 3 has **1 RFP**, Hard Cover.

Roll 1d6: **4** = **Ready**

MG Team 3 survives and may respond.

**Attacker Consolidation:**

Removing the destroyed defenders causes Rifle Teams A and B to no longer be in base contact with enemy. They may each move **3"**, including into contact with another enemy Team.

- Rifle Team A moves 3" along the hedgerow into contact with MG Team 3
- Rifle Team B moves 3" along the hedgerow into contact with MG Team 3
- The PL moves to maintain base contact with Rifle Team A

Now Rifle Team A and Rifle Team B are both in contact with MG Team 3. The PL is in base contact with Rifle Team A.

Rifle Team C was in contact with MG Team 2 (destroyed). Rifle Team C moves 3" along the hedgerow toward MG Team 3.

*MG Team 3 already has two attackers in contact (the maximum). Rifle Team C cannot contact and stops adjacent.*

**Defender Response:**

MG Team 3 may now either **Move** away or roll an **Assault Check** to destroy one assaulting Team in contact.

The German player chooses to roll an Assault Check against Rifle Team A.

Roll 4+: **3** = **Failed**

The MG Team fails to destroy the attacker.

**Attacker Assault Checks:**

Rifle Team A and Rifle Team B are in contact with MG Team 3. Each rolls an **Assault Check** (4+) to destroy the defender.

**Rifle Team A** rolls: **2** = **Failed**

The PL is in base contact with Rifle Team A. **Leaders in base contact allow re-rolls on failed Assault Checks.**

**Rifle Team A** re-rolls: **4** = **Success!**

MG Team 3 is **Destroyed**.

**End of Assault:**

No defenders remain in contact. The assault ends.

**Regroup:** Any Team that started in contact with enemy but ends out of contact (by destroying them or moving away) becomes **Suppressed**.

- Rifle Team A: Was in contact, enemy destroyed → **Suppressed**
- Rifle Team B: Was in contact, enemy destroyed → **Suppressed**
- Rifle Team C: Was in contact (with MG Team 2, destroyed by RFP), moved but didn't contact new enemy → **Suppressed**
- PL: Was in contact with Rifle Team A, not with enemy → Not suppressed

*The assault succeeded, but the attackers are now disorganized and vulnerable to counterattack.*

---

### Activation 3 *(1 Order Point spent)*

The US player wants to get the remaining Sherman back into action. The Sherman Platoon was already activated this turn by an Order Point—they cannot be activated again by Order Points.

The US player spends **1 Hero Point** to re-activate the Sherman Platoon.

**Current Sherman Status:**
- Sherman 1: Suppressed (from RFP resolution earlier), no RFPs
- Sherman 2: **DESTROYED**
- Sherman 3: 1 RFP (from PaK40 hit)

The US player orders the Shermans to **Fire** at the PaK40.

**Activation Sequence:**
1. Declare orders ← *Done: Fire at PaK40*
2. Rally Check
3. Resolve RFPs
4. Execute orders

**Rally Check:**

Sherman 1 is Suppressed with no RFPs. It attempts a Rally Check.

Roll 4+: **2** = **Failed**

Sherman 1 remains Suppressed.

**Resolving RFPs:**

Sherman 3 has **1 RFP**. Vehicles count as Hard Cover.

Roll 1d6: **5** = **Ready**

The crew confirms the tank is still operational.

**Executing the Fire Order:**

Sherman 1 is Suppressed—it **cannot Fire**.

Sherman 3 Fires alone. RoF 2, AT 4.

Range to PaK40: 16" (standard range). HE ignores concealment.

Target number: **4+**

Roll 2 dice: **3, 6** = **1 hit**

The PaK40 receives **1 RFP**.

Hero Points remaining (US): **5**

---

### Activation 4 *(1 Order Point spent)*

The US player re-activates the **Rifle Platoon Leader** using **1 Hero Point**.

The PL orders the three Suppressed Rifle Teams at the hedgerow to **Move**.

**Fall Back:** Suppressed Teams that start or end their activation outside of LoS to any enemy Teams automatically remove their suppressed status.

The three Rifle Teams are currently at the hedgerow on the US side, having assaulted into contact with it. The farmhouse is behind the hedgerow from their perspective, and the farmhouse MG Teams have LoS over the hedgerow to the US positions. To break LoS, the Rifle Teams need to move **away** from the hedgerow, back toward the wheat field, where terrain will block the farmhouse's view.

The three Rifle Teams fall back 2d6" toward the wheat field.

Roll 2d6: **3, 5** = **8 inches**

They withdraw 8" from the hedgerow, reaching the edge of the wheat field where the standing grain blocks LoS from the farmhouse.

**Suppression automatically removed** from Rifle Team A, Rifle Team B, and Rifle Team C.

The PL moves up to 12" to join them at the wheat field.

The PL uses his **Leader Ability** to grant one Rifle Team **+3" movement**, pulling Rifle Team A deeper into the wheat field for better concealment, ending in base contact with the Leader.

Hero Points remaining (US): **4**

---

### Activation 5 *(1 Order Point spent)*

The US player has 2 Order Points remaining and 4 Hero Points.

The Rifle Platoon was activated twice (once by Order Point, once by Hero Point). The Sherman Platoon was activated twice (once by Order Point, once by Hero Point). Neither can activate again this turn.

The US player **ends their turn**.

Order Points remaining: **2** (unspent)
Hero Points remaining: **4**

---

## Mechanics Demonstrated

This single turn example demonstrated:

1. **Order Point generation** — Roll 2d6, take higher (rolled 5, 5 = 5 Order Points)

2. **Doubles and Hero Points** — Rolling doubles forced revealing and re-rolling the Hero Die (lost 4, gained 6)

3. **Vehicle unit activation** — Shermans activated together with shared LoS to target

4. **Hero Point interrupt** — German player interrupted US turn to activate the AT Platoon

5. **Activation sequence** — Orders declared before RFP resolution (shown explicitly with Sherman Fire order)

6. **RFP resolution with all three outcomes:**
   - Sherman: Suppressed (roll of 3) — tank still operational but cannot fire
   - PaK40: Suppressed (roll of 2) — then Rallied by Leader
   - US Rifle Team: Killed (roll of 2)
   - MG Teams in assault: Suppressed (destroyed per assault rules) and Killed
   - MG Team 3: Ready (roll of 4) — survived to fight back

7. **Armor penetration:**
   - First Sherman hit: AT 5 vs AR 2, difference 3, rolled a 6 = **Destroyed**
   - Second Sherman hit: AT 5 vs AR 2, difference 3, no 6s = **1 RFP assigned**

8. **Firing procedure with hit allocation** — Multiple hits distributed to Teams within 4", including splitting between Shermans

9. **Platoon Leader activation** — PL activated unit and issued two split orders (Fire and Move/Assault)

10. **Leader abilities demonstrated:**
    - Rally (AT PL rallied the suppressed PaK40)
    - Re-roll failed Assault Check (Rifle Team A failed first roll of 2, re-rolled to 4 with PL support)
    - +3" movement (PL pulled Rifle Team A deeper into wheat field)

11. **Assault sequence:**
    - Movement into base contact (across linear obstacle)
    - Defenders immediately activate and resolve RFPs
    - Non-Ready defenders destroyed (MG Teams 1 and 2)
    - Attackers consolidate 3" into contact with remaining defender
    - Ready defender rolls Assault Check (failed with 3)
    - Attackers roll Assault Checks (Rifle Team A failed, re-rolled with PL, succeeded)
    - Regroup: all attackers who were in contact become Suppressed

12. **Fall Back** — Suppressed Teams moved away from hedgerow to end outside enemy LoS, automatically removing suppression

13. **Small Teams** — Bazooka fired but could not participate in assault

14. **Fog of war** — The Sherman with 2 RFPs had unknown fate until activated; the PaK40's suppression was resolved during the German interrupt

---

*The US assault shattered the German hedgerow position but cost them a Sherman and a Rifle Team. Three MG Teams were destroyed in the assault. The Americans fell back to the wheat field to regroup, leaving the hedgerow unoccupied. The PaK40 still threatens the road with 1 RFP to resolve next turn. The German player faces a choice: counterattack the wheat field from the farmhouse, or dig in and wait for the American assault to continue?*
