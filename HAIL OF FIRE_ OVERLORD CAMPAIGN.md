**HAIL OF FIRE: OPERATION OVERLORD CAMPAIGN**

**8-Week Multiplayer Campaign Rules**

**CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW**

This is a flexible, map-based campaign where players fight for control of Normandy over 8 weeks. Players schedule games at their convenience, fight for sectors on the campaign map, and earn raffle coins for recognition and potential prizes.

⠀The campaign is designed to specifically accommodate any level of participation \- play one game or twenty\!

**Core Principles:**

* Play as much or as little as you want

* Bring whatever forces you want (within reason)

* Change your army between games freely

* Everyone has a fair shot at recognition and prizes

* Earn bonus coins by supporting the store

**JOINING THE CAMPAIGN**

**To Join:**

1. Declare your forces: **Axis** or **Allied**

2. Add your name to the campaign roster (Discord/store)

3. Start scheduling games\!

⠀**Your declared side determines:**

* Which "winning side" raffle you're eligible for at campaign end

* That's it. If need be, you can still play games representing either side during the campaign

**SCHEDULING & PLAYING GAMES**

**Step 1: Schedule a Game**

* Contact another campaign participant (Discord/in-store)

* Agree on date/time to play

* Determine who will play Allied and who will play Axis for this game

**⠀Step 2: Roll for Initiative**

* Both players roll 1d6

* **Allied player adds \+1 to their roll and wins ties**

* High roll wins initiative

**⠀Step 3: Winner Chooses Battlefield**

* Initiative winner declares which friendly sector will be attacking which adjacent enemy sector (paradrops excepted)

* **Important:** If the attacker loses the battle, they lose the sector they attacked FROM

**⠀Step 4: Build Your Forces**

* Build any force you want. You can use the Force Parity Procedure to balance the scenario.

**⠀Step 5: Meet & Reveal Forces**

* Show each other your forces

* Count vehicle teams (tanks, half-tracks, armored cars, etc.)

* **Player with more vehicles \= Scenario Attacker**

* If tied, initiative winner chooses.

* **Check coin totals:** Each player announces how many rerolls they have (coins ÷ 4\)

**⠀Step 6: Calculate Modifiers**

See "Breakpoint Modifiers" section below

**Step 7: Play the Game**

Standard Hail of Fire game using chosen forces

**Step 8: Resolve Sector Control**

* Winner captures the losers sector

  * **Exception:** Landing sectors (Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword) cannot be captured by Axis \- ifAxis would capture a landing sector, no sector changes hands

* Update store map immediately (move pins)

**Step 9: Report Results**

* Both players post to Discord:

* \[SECTOR NAME/CODE\] \- \[Winner\] defeats \[Loser\]

* Initiative: \[Who won roll-off\]Attack: \[Sector attacked\] FROM \[Sector attacked from\]Result: \[Which sector changed hands\]

* Modifiers: \[list adjacency/supply/terrain\]

* @opponent (confirm with 👍 emoji)

**MAP MECHANICS**

**Sector Control**

**Starting Positions:**

* **Allied starting sectors:** Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword (5 landing sectors)

* **German starting sectors:** All other sectors on the map

* Most of the map begins under German control

**Adjacency Bonuses**

**Attacker Only:**

* **\+1 Breakpoint for each additional friendly sector bordering the target after the first** (the sector you're attacking from)

* **Maximum \+2 Breakpoint** (even if you control more sectors)

⠀**Example:** Allies attack Caen from E2

* Caen has 6 bordering sectors total

* Allies control: E1, E2, E3, and E4 (3 additional sectors)

* Allied adjacency bonus: Would be \+3, capped at **\+2 BP**

* German adjacency bonus: 0 BP (defender never receives adjacency bonus)

⠀**Strategic Note:** Controlling 2+ sectors around a target maximizes your adjacency bonus. Beyond that, additional sectors don't increase BP but may serve other strategic purposes (cutting supply, opening new attack routes).

**Supply Lines**

A sector is **supplied** if the shortest path to a supply source uses only friendly sectors.

**Supply Sources:**

* **Allied:** Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword, or captured paradrop sectors

* **Axis:** C7, D8, or E9

⠀**How to Check:**

1. Count sectors to your nearest supply source

2. If multiple paths tie for shortest, you only need ONE of them to be all friendly

3. That shortest route must be all friendly sectors \- longer routes don't count

⠀**Unsupplied Penalty:** Reduce the Morale of all units by 1

**Landing Sectors**

* Landing sectors: **Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword** (the 5 Allied starting positions)

* Landing sectors always count as Allied supply sources

* If Axis win a battle where the Allied attack originated from a landing sector, the landing sector remains Allied

* Allies get **\+2 Breakpoints** when fighting in landing sectors (attacking or defending)

* Landing sectors represent the permanent Allied beachhead and overwhelming naval/air superiority

**Flooded Sectors:**

* If paradropping into flooded sector: \-1 BP additional penalty

**Terrain (Farmland, Bocage, City, Flooded):**

* Suggested terrain for your table setup, but not at all required

* Players may agree to house rules if desired

**PARADROP RULES**

Allied players may conduct paradrops:

**Requirements:**

* Win the initiative roll (1d6+1 vs opponent's 1d6)

* Choose any German sector NOT adjacent to Allied sectors

* **Choose a enemy-adjacent, non-landing Allied sector the attack originates from.** That sector is captured if the paradrop fails

**Restrictions:**

* **No Vehicles** \-  Infantry and light guns only

**Flooded Sector Paradrop:**

* **\-1 Breakpoint** penalty to Allies (difficult landing conditions)

**Results:**

* **Allied victory:** Sector becomes Allied-controlled AND becomes an Allied supply source (like landing sectors)

* **German victory:** Germans capture the Allied sector the paradrop originated from

**BREAKPOINT MODIFIERS**

* **Initiative Winner:** **\+1 BP** per additional friendly sector bordering the target (beyond sector attacking from), maximum \+2 BP

* **Allies Only:** Flat **\+2 BP** if fighting from a landing sector (Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword)

* **Flooded Sector Paradrop:** **\-1 BP** penalty to Allies (difficult landing conditions)
